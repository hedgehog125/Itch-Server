**Update from future me**: This is probably horrifically insecure, so run at your own risk. Although it's not too bad since it's only designed to run on a LAN.

# Itch-Server
The server for Itch, allows easy saving/loading and sharing projects with your LAN.

# If you've ever installed one of my web servers on your computer skip straight to "Running".

# Installing
The Itch server is written in python.
  
Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ make sure you download python 3+


# Running

# Mac/Linux users:
1) (Linux only) Right click on the file and choose Properties > Permissions and tick "Allow executing this file as a program" (at the bottom)
2) Double-click "RUNME For Mac And Linux.sh"


# Windows users:
1) Double-click "RUNME For Windows.py"


# Accessing
When you run the server it should say "Listening on http://<[your ip]>:8000" simply copy and paste the url that the server printed into your browser.
You can also access the website from other computers, providing you're on the same network.

# Stopping

To stop the server simply just close the window, it might ask if you're sure but just press "Ok".

Enjoy! :D
